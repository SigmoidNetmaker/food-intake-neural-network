# food-intake-neural-network
This repository contains Maude and MATLAB code that parameterizes, implements, and analyzes a neural network model of the hypothalamic and other neuron types that control food intake. The essential feature is that the model, though simple, still has many states, and some of those states correspond to patterns of observed neural resopnses that experimentalists had heretofore considered anomalous. The same model is implemented both in MATLAB (an imperative language) and in Maude (a declarative language). The two different programming modalities offer complementary functionality.

Development and analysis of the model and its neurobiological implications are discussed in detail in: Tabe-Bordbar S, Anastasio TJ. Computational analysis of the hypothalamic control of food intake. Frontiers in computational neuroscience. 2016 Apr 26;10:27.
